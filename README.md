Getting Started
---------------

* To build the backend project, run `mvn package`.
* To run the backend application, use the provided `startup.sh` script or run the project's jar file directly. The server will start on localhost on port 8080.
* The embedded H2 database will be automatically configured based on your entities when the application starts up.
* Feel free to make any modifications to the existing code that you see fit so long as you continue to use Maven, Spring Boot, and Hibernate.
